Children can represent information about objects early in development. They can learn their names, their quantity, their current state. However, often objects are acted upon by people, opening up new ways for objects to be represented. One line of my research investigates how objects can be represented, not just by their own properties, but the qualities that other people bestow onto them (i.e., their own preferences and beliefs).
